TROUBLESHOOTING FOR FRESH MACHINES:

🔧 If the executable won't run:
1. Install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable:
   - Download from: https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe
   - This is required for PyInstaller executables

🛡️ If Windows Defender blocks it:
1. Right-click the executable → Properties → Unblock
2. Or add the folder to Windows Defender exclusions
3. Or run as Administrator

🌐 If browser installation fails:
1. Run as Administrator: linkedin-network-builder.exe --install-browsers
2. Ensure internet connection is stable
3. Check Windows Firewall isn't blocking downloads

🔒 If ngrok fails to start:
1. Check if corporate firewall blocks ngrok
2. Try running as Administrator
3. Some corporate networks block tunnel services

💡 Alternative for corporate environments:
- The application can run locally without ngrok
- Access API directly at http://localhost:8001/docs
- Manual GPT setup may be required

SUPPORT:
- Check console output for detailed error messages
- Most issues are resolved by running as Administrator
- Ensure antivirus isn't blocking the application

The application is completely self-contained and requires no additional software installation beyond the optional Visual C++ Redistributable!
